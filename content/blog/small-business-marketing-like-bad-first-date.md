A funny but practical look at the habits that make customers ghost you and how to fix them.

You know the kind of date I am talking about.

*   They show up late.
*   They talk only about themselves.
*   They keep checking their phone.

By dessert, you are mentally drafting an escape plan that involves faking a sudden allergy attack.

Here is the kicker: that is exactly how your small business can come across to potential customers.

## 1\. You Are Talking Too Much About Yourself

Your website says, _“We have been family owned since 1987.”_ Cool. But what about me, the customer? Do I get free dessert with that? Customers do not want your autobiography. They want to know what problem you solve for them today.

  

**Fix it:** Flip every “we” sentence into a “you” sentence. Instead of “We offer lawn care,” try “Your weekends are for hammocks, not weed whackers.”

## 2\. You Are Not Listening

Ever been on a date where the other person ignores what you just said? That is how customers feel when they ask a question on your Facebook page, and your business replies three weeks later with a coupon code.

  

**Fix it:** Respond like a human, fast. Bonus points if you are funny. “We will get back to you within 24 hours” is nice. “We are faster than your pizza delivery guy” is better.

  

## 3\. You Are Overdressed or Underdressed

Your branding should match your audience. If your target customer is local farmers, do not show up in a three piece corporate suit of stock photos and jargon. If your audience is luxury homeowners, do not wear flip flops made of Comic Sans.

  

**Fix it:** Audit your look. Does your website, logo, and tone of voice feel like what your ideal customer would actually swipe right on?

## 4\. You Are Checking Your Phone Too Much

If your marketing is all about chasing shiny objects like every new social platform or AI gimmick, you are the distracted date scrolling mid conversation.

  

**Fix it:** Pick one or two channels and commit. Depth beats dabbling. Nobody falls in love with “kind of consistent.”

## The Takeaway

Marketing, like dating, is not about fireworks. It is about connection, attention, and showing up as your best self, consistently. Do that, and you will not be another bad date people warn their friends about. You will be the one they cannot stop talking about.
