Small business marketing doesn’t have to feel like driving a 1989 sedan with three missing hubcaps and an “I brake for squirrels” bumper sticker. You don’t need a Madison Avenue budget or a secret marketing degree to make big improvements. You just need a few quick fixes, and maybe a sense of humor when things get weird.

Here are five quick ways to tune up your small business marketing without selling a kidney:

1.  **Stop Whispering Into the Void (a.k.a. Claim Your Google Business Profile) —** Imagine setting up a shop but forgetting to unlock the front door. That’s what it’s like when you don’t claim your Google Business Profile. It’s free, it’s easy, and it’s the first place customers look for directions, reviews, and your hours. **Pro tip:** Post updates and photos regularly. Bonus if you upload a picture of your staff not looking like they’ve been kidnapped.
    
2.  **Write Like a Human, Not a Robot —** We’ve all seen the website copy that reads like a toaster wrote it: “We synergistically leverage innovative solutions to maximize customer-centric paradigms.” Please don’t. Instead, write like you’re explaining what you do to your neighbor. Real words, real benefits. Customers don’t care about “solutions.” They care that you’ll fix their leaky sink, groom their hairy dog, or make their latte without spelling their name as “Khrysthophyr.”
    
3.  **Make Social Media a Party, Not a Sales Pitch —** Posting “Buy now!” 37 times a week is like being the guy at the barbecue who only talks about his timeshare. Mix it up.
    
    *   Share behind-the-scenes stories.
    *   Post customer wins.
    *   Drop a quick tip that makes your followers feel smarter.
    
    When in doubt, add a dog picture. Science says engagement goes up 472% (okay, maybe not science, but definitely Instagram).
    
4.  **Email Is Still Alive (Stop Acting Like It’s a Fossil) —** Yes, people still check their email, usually while pretending to work. Build a simple list of your customers and send a monthly update. It doesn’t have to be fancy.
    
    *   Share a tip.
    *   Highlight a service.
    *   Remind them you exist.
    
    Keep it short. Nobody wants to read your version of _War and Peace_.
    
5.  **Track Something (Anything, Please) —** Small business marketing isn’t magic. It’s math in disguise. If you’re spending money on ads, track clicks. If you’re posting on social, track engagement. If you’re sending emails, track opens. Even better: pick one number that matters most (calls, leads, appointments) and focus on making that number go up. Otherwise, you’ll end up like a driver who insists they’re “making good time” while headed the wrong direction.
    

**Final Lap —** Small business marketing doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Start with these quick wins: claim your Google profile, write like a human, mix up your social posts, send short emails, and track at least one thing. Do these consistently and you’ll look less like a marketing rookie and more like someone cruising confidently in the carpool lane.
