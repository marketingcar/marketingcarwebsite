    "title": "Five Small Business Marketing Tips That Won’t Make You Cry",
    "slug": "small-business-marketing-crying",
    "content": "<article>\n  <p>\n    Running a small business can feel like juggling chainsaws while smiling at customers. Add marketing to the mix and you are suddenly a designer, copywriter, and social media manager. The good news is you do not need a huge budget to make real progress. Use these simple, funny, and actually useful tips to get traction.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>1. Treat Social Media Like a Potluck</h2>\n  <p>\n    You do not have to bring a five course meal. Show up with something people want. Share a short video tip, a customer story, or a simple meme that fits your brand voice. Consistency beats perfection.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Ask yourself, Would I share this with a friend, or would I mute myself? If it is the second one, try again.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>2. Your Website Is Your Storefront</h2>\n  <p>\n    If your site is slow, outdated, or missing basic info, it feels like a shop with the lights off. Make sure visitors can figure out what you do in under 30 seconds.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Clear headline that says what you do and for whom</li>\n    <li>Services or products listed in plain language</li>\n    <li>Current hours and location</li>\n    <li>A visible call to action like Contact Us or Book Now</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Run a quick check on mobile. If you have to pinch and zoom like it is 2012, fix that first.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>3. Email Marketing Is Free Real Estate in the Brain</h2>\n  <p>\n    Email is very much alive, but your subject line has to earn the click. Write like a human, not like a tax form.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Bad: August Newsletter</li>\n    <li>Better: The Dog Ate Our Marketing Plan and Yours Is Inside</li>\n    <li>Great: Want 20 Percent Off Before We Regret This</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Keep messages short. One idea, one link, one clear call to action. Make it easy to skim.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>4. Reviews Are Word of Mouth With a Megaphone</h2>\n  <p>\n    People trust strangers on the internet more than their cousins. Ask for reviews right after a positive interaction, while the good vibes are fresh.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Text or email a direct review link with two sentence instructions</li>\n    <li>Offer a small perk like a discount or a raffle entry</li>\n    <li>Respond to every review with gratitude and specifics</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Embed your best reviews on your website and use quotes in social posts.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>5. Pick Two Channels and Own Them</h2>\n  <p>\n    You do not need to be on every platform. Choose the two places your audience already uses and commit to them. Show up on a schedule, keep the message consistent, and measure results.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>If you sell to other businesses, try LinkedIn and email</li>\n    <li>If you sell local services, try Google Business Profile and Instagram</li>\n    <li>If you teach or demo, try YouTube and a monthly newsletter</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Depth beats breadth. Ten strong posts will beat one hundred forgettable ones.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Quick Tune Up Checklist</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Post one helpful tip per week on your primary social channel</li>\n    <li>Refresh your homepage headline and call to action</li>\n    <li>Send one short email with one clear offer</li>\n    <li>Request three reviews from happy customers</li>\n    <li>Choose two channels and set a simple weekly cadence</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Final Lap</h2>\n  <p>\n    Marketing does not have to feel like pushing a car uphill. Start small, stay consistent, and keep your message clear. Help people solve a problem, make them smile, and make the next step obvious. That is how you build momentum without burning out.\n  </p>\n</article>\n",

    "content": "<article itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n  <header>\n\n    <p itemprop=\"description\">A funny but practical look at the habits that make customers ghost you and how to fix them.</p>\n  </header>\n\n  <p>You know the kind of date I am talking about.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>They show up late.</li>\n    <li>They talk only about themselves.</li>\n    <li>They keep checking their phone.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>By dessert, you are mentally drafting an escape plan that involves faking a sudden allergy attack.</p>\n  <p>Here is the kicker: that is exactly how your small business can come across to potential customers.</p>\n\n  <h2>1. You Are Talking Too Much About Yourself</h2>\n  <p>Your website says, <em>“We have been family owned since 1987.”</em> Cool. But what about me, the customer? Do I get free dessert with that? Customers do not want your autobiography. They want to know what problem you solve for them today.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Flip every “we” sentence into a “you” sentence. Instead of “We offer lawn care,” try “Your weekends are for hammocks, not weed whackers.”</p>\n\n  <h2>2. You Are Not Listening</h2>\n  <p>Ever been on a date where the other person ignores what you just said? That is how customers feel when they ask a question on your Facebook page, and your business replies three weeks later with a coupon code.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Respond like a human, fast. Bonus points if you are funny. “We will get back to you within 24 hours” is nice. “We are faster than your pizza delivery guy” is better.</p>\n<br />\n  <h2>3. You Are Overdressed or Underdressed</h2>\n  <p>Your branding should match your audience. If your target customer is local farmers, do not show up in a three piece corporate suit of stock photos and jargon. If your audience is luxury homeowners, do not wear flip flops made of Comic Sans.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Audit your look. Does your website, logo, and tone of voice feel like what your ideal customer would actually swipe right on?</p>\n\n  <h2>4. You Are Checking Your Phone Too Much</h2>\n  <p>If your marketing is all about chasing shiny objects like every new social platform or AI gimmick, you are the distracted date scrolling mid conversation.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Pick one or two channels and commit. Depth beats dabbling. Nobody falls in love with “kind of consistent.”</p>\n\n  <h2>The Takeaway</h2>\n  <p>Marketing, like dating, is not about fireworks. It is about connection, attention, and showing up as your best self, consistently. Do that, and you will not be another bad date people warn their friends about. You will be the one they cannot stop talking about.</p>\n</article>\n",

You’re burning time, money, and maybe a little hope—but you’re still not getting anywhere fast.</p>\n\n    <p>So what’s the problem? Is it your logo? Your website? Your 2015 Facebook page that hasn’t been updated since the Ice Age? Maybe. But here’s the truth no one wants to say out loud:</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>It’s not just your marketing tools—it’s your marketing vehicle.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>The Problem: Piecemeal Marketing Is a Dead End</h2>\n\n    <p>Too many businesses treat marketing like a buffet: a little SEO here, a splash of Instagram there, maybe toss in some Google Ads and call it a day. But without a strategy tying it all together, you're just throwing spaghetti at the wall and praying it sticks.</p>\n\n    <p>It won’t.</p>\n\n    <p>That’s because your <strong>ads, content, website, brand, messaging, and follow-up systems</strong> all need to work like a car engine—in sync, not in silos.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>The Fix: Build a Marketing Machine, Not a Marketing Mess</h2>\n\n    <p>At Marketing Car, we don’t slap a fresh coat of paint on a rusted clunker.

We audit what’s working, what’s wasting your money, and what your competitors are doing while you’re stuck in traffic.</p>\n\n    <h3>2. Build your strategy like a road map.</h3>\n    <p>No vague goals. We get clear on your destination—then chart the fastest route to get you there.</p>\n\n    <h3>3. Tune-up every system.</h3>\n    <p>Your website isn’t just a digital brochure. Your ads aren’t magic. Your messaging needs to make people say, “YES.” We align every piece so it drives results, not just traffic.</p>\n\n    <h3>4. Put you in the driver’s seat.</h3>\n    <p>We don’t gatekeep. You’ll understand what we’re doing, why it matters, and how to steer your own success.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>You Don’t Need More Tools. You Need a Whole Damn Car.</h2>\n\n    <p>Marketing isn’t a checklist—it’s a <strong>vehicle for growth</strong>.

    "content": "<p>Every week, someone shows up in our inbox thinking they need a new engine. Their leads dried up. Their calendar’s empty. Their ads flopped. Their website traffic tanked. So they assume they need a total rebuild.</p>\n\n<p>But most of the time?<br />\nThe problem isn’t the car. It’s the map.</p>\n\n<h2>Trendy Tactics Won’t Save You</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>If you’ve tried the “just post more” plan…</li>\n  <li>If you’ve spent money on one-size-fits-all ads…</li>\n  <li>If you’ve rewritten your homepage ten times and still aren’t converting...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You're not alone. And you’re not broken.<br />\nYou’ve just been following someone else’s GPS.</p>\n\n<p>The internet is full of recycled strategies and prebuilt marketing “playbooks” that treat every business like it sells the same thing to the same person, in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not strategy. That’s a shortcut to nowhere.</p>\n\n<h2>Here’s the Hard Truth</h2>\n<p>Marketing can’t fix a broken business.<br />\nAnd tactics can’t replace strategy.</p>\n\n<p>At Marketing Car, we don’t just throw new tools at you. We get under the hood and look at everything: your market, your vision, your brand, your website, your tech stack, your CRM, your actual business goals—not just vanity metrics.</p>\n\n<p>Then we build a route that gets you where you want to go.</p>\n\n<p>Efficiently. Intentionally. Without stalling out halfway there.</p>\n\n<h2>What We Call Strategy (And What Most People Don’t)</h2>\n<p>Real strategy is how you get from where you are to where you want to be. It's not just a Gantt chart. It's not a funnel template. It's not a bunch of jargon-laced PDFs.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Strategic Pillars that keep your priorities in check</li>\n  <li>A Clear Mission and Vision that align your efforts</li>\n  <li>Objectives you can rally your team behind</li>\n  <li>SMART Goals that actually move the needle</li>\n  <li>Tactics that are tied to a real, measurable path</li>\n  <li>KPIs that track the right things—not just the easiest things</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And if one gear in that system is off, everything else struggles.<br />\nThat’s why we look at the whole car.</p>\n\n<h2>Ready for a Better Route?</h2>\n<p>We’re not here to sell you speed. We’re here to help you stop driving blind. The right route, the right tools, the right message—built around your business, not someone else’s.</p>\n\n<p>Because growth isn’t an accident.<br />\nIt’s what happens when strategy meets action—with a real map in hand.</p>\n",

It’s about where you’re going.</p>\n\n<h2>Your Check Engine Light Is On—and You Know It</h2>\n<p>Quiet inbox. Empty calendar. Endless tweaks to your homepage at midnight.
