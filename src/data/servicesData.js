      <h3>Your Roadmap to Marketing Success</h3>
      <p>We do not hand you a pretty PDF and wish you luck. We build a plan you can actually drive, with lanes, turn signals, and a real destination.</p>

      <h4>Our Strategic Approach</h4>
      <p>Discovery is not small talk. We dig into market position, competitors, and what your audience really cares about. Then we map channels that work together instead of fighting for budget.</p>

      <h4>Data-Driven Decisions</h4>
      <p>Gut checks meet hard numbers. We define KPIs up front so you can see traction, not guess at it.</p>

      <h4>Implementation and Support</h4>
      <p>A plan without execution is a parking lot. We can coach your team or run the playbook for you. No mystery levers. No smoke.</p>

      <h3>Your Digital Storefront, Engineered for Speed and Safety</h3>
      <p>We build fully custom sites using a modern React stack with Static Site Generation. You get the control of a custom build and the peace of mind of a static site that is fast, secure, and easy to scale.</p>

      <h4>Why Custom Beats Templates</h4>
      <p>Templates start cheap and end expensive. You spend hours fighting layouts and plugins that were not designed for your brand. We design around your goals first, then ship only the parts you need. No theme bloat. No plugin roulette.</p>

      <h4>Why SSG Beats WordPress for Security and Performance</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smaller attack surface:</strong> Static files mean there is no live database to hack and no PHP admin panel to brute force.</li>
        <li><strong>Fewer moving parts:</strong> No monthly plugin patch parade. Fewer updates. Fewer surprises.</li>
        <li><strong>CDN native:</strong> Pages are prebuilt and served globally. Time to first byte is fast, even on mobile.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO friendly:</strong> Real HTML at every route. Search engines crawl with less effort and more accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilient by default:</strong> Traffic spikes do not melt servers. Static sites scale without drama.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Editing Without the Headache</h4>
      <p>You still get an editor. We use a git-based CMS so content changes are simple, trackable, and safe. Think clean revision history instead of mystery edits.</p>

      <h4>UX and Conversion</h4>
      <p>We map the buyer journey, remove friction, and design pages that help visitors do what they came to do.</p>

      <h4>Ongoing Care</h4>
      <p>We maintain the build pipeline, run backups, and monitor performance. You focus on customers. We handle the nerdy bits.</p>
