You don’t need a Madison Avenue budget or a secret marketing degree to make big improvements. You just need a few quick fixes, and maybe a sense of humor when things get weird.</p>\n\n  <p>Here are five quick ways to tune up your small business marketing without selling a kidney:</p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Stop Whispering Into the Void (a.k.a. Claim Your Google Business Profile) —</strong> Imagine setting up a shop but forgetting to unlock the front door. That’s what it’s like when you don’t claim your Google Business Profile. It’s free, it’s easy, and it’s the first place customers look for directions, reviews, and your hours. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Post updates and photos regularly. Bonus if you upload a picture of your staff not looking like they’ve been kidnapped.</p>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Write Like a Human, Not a Robot —</strong> We’ve all seen the website copy that reads like a toaster wrote it: “We synergistically leverage innovative solutions to maximize customer-centric paradigms.” Please don’t. Instead, write like you’re explaining what you do to your neighbor. Real words, real benefits. Customers don’t care about “solutions.” They care that you’ll fix their leaky sink, groom their hairy dog, or make their latte without spelling their name as “Khrysthophyr.”</p>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Make Social Media a Party, Not a Sales Pitch —</strong> Posting “Buy now!” 37 times a week is like being the guy at the barbecue who only talks about his timeshare. Mix it up.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Share behind-the-scenes stories.</li>\n        <li>Post customer wins.</li>\n        <li>Drop a quick tip that makes your followers feel smarter.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>When in doubt, add a dog picture. Science says engagement goes up 472% (okay, maybe not science, but definitely Instagram).</p>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Email Is Still Alive (Stop Acting Like It’s a Fossil) —</strong> Yes, people still check their email, usually while pretending to work. Build a simple list of your customers and send a monthly update. It doesn’t have to be fancy.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Share a tip.</li>\n        <li>Highlight a service.</li>\n        <li>Remind them you exist.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Keep it short. Nobody wants to read your version of <em>War and Peace</em>.</p>\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Track Something (Anything, Please) —</strong> Small business marketing isn’t magic. It’s math in disguise. If you’re spending money on ads, track clicks. If you’re posting on social, track engagement. If you’re sending emails, track opens. Even better: pick one number that matters most (calls, leads, appointments) and focus on making that number go up. Otherwise, you’ll end up like a driver who insists they’re “making good time” while headed the wrong direction.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p><strong>Final Lap —</strong> Small business marketing doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Start with these quick wins: claim your Google profile, write like a human, mix up your social posts, send short emails, and track at least one thing. Do these consistently and you’ll look less like a marketing rookie and more like someone cruising confidently in the carpool lane.</p>\n\n  <p>Need more help? That’s what we do at Marketing Car.

Add marketing to the mix and you are suddenly a designer, copywriter, and social media manager. The good news is you do not need a huge budget to make real progress. Use these simple, funny, and actually useful tips to get traction.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>1. Treat Social Media Like a Potluck</h2>\n  <p>\n    You do not have to bring a five course meal. Show up with something people want. Share a short video tip, a customer story, or a simple meme that fits your brand voice. Consistency beats perfection.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Ask yourself, Would I share this with a friend, or would I mute myself? If it is the second one, try again.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>2. Your Website Is Your Storefront</h2>\n  <p>\n    If your site is slow, outdated, or missing basic info, it feels like a shop with the lights off. Make sure visitors can figure out what you do in under 30 seconds.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Clear headline that says what you do and for whom</li>\n    <li>Services or products listed in plain language</li>\n    <li>Current hours and location</li>\n    <li>A visible call to action like Contact Us or Book Now</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Run a quick check on mobile. If you have to pinch and zoom like it is 2012, fix that first.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>3. Email Marketing Is Free Real Estate in the Brain</h2>\n  <p>\n    Email is very much alive, but your subject line has to earn the click. Write like a human, not like a tax form.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Bad: August Newsletter</li>\n    <li>Better: The Dog Ate Our Marketing Plan and Yours Is Inside</li>\n    <li>Great: Want 20 Percent Off Before We Regret This</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Keep messages short. One idea, one link, one clear call to action. Make it easy to skim.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>4. Reviews Are Word of Mouth With a Megaphone</h2>\n  <p>\n    People trust strangers on the internet more than their cousins. Ask for reviews right after a positive interaction, while the good vibes are fresh.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Text or email a direct review link with two sentence instructions</li>\n    <li>Offer a small perk like a discount or a raffle entry</li>\n    <li>Respond to every review with gratitude and specifics</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Embed your best reviews on your website and use quotes in social posts.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>5. Pick Two Channels and Own Them</h2>\n  <p>\n    You do not need to be on every platform. Choose the two places your audience already uses and commit to them. Show up on a schedule, keep the message consistent, and measure results.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>If you sell to other businesses, try LinkedIn and email</li>\n    <li>If you sell local services, try Google Business Profile and Instagram</li>\n    <li>If you teach or demo, try YouTube and a monthly newsletter</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Depth beats breadth. Ten strong posts will beat one hundred forgettable ones.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Quick Tune Up Checklist</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Post one helpful tip per week on your primary social channel</li>\n    <li>Refresh your homepage headline and call to action</li>\n    <li>Send one short email with one clear offer</li>\n    <li>Request three reviews from happy customers</li>\n    <li>Choose two channels and set a simple weekly cadence</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Final Lap</h2>\n  <p>\n    Marketing does not have to feel like pushing a car uphill. Start small, stay consistent, and keep your message clear. Help people solve a problem, make them smile, and make the next step obvious. That is how you build momentum without burning out.\n  </p>\n</article>\n",excerpt:"Running a small business can feel like juggling chainsaws while smiling at customers.

You Are Talking Too Much About Yourself</h2>\n  <p>Your website says, <em>“We have been family owned since 1987.”</em> Cool. But what about me, the customer? Do I get free dessert with that? Customers do not want your autobiography. They want to know what problem you solve for them today.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Flip every “we” sentence into a “you” sentence. Instead of “We offer lawn care,” try “Your weekends are for hammocks, not weed whackers.”</p>\n\n  <h2>2. You Are Not Listening</h2>\n  <p>Ever been on a date where the other person ignores what you just said? That is how customers feel when they ask a question on your Facebook page, and your business replies three weeks later with a coupon code.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Respond like a human, fast. Bonus points if you are funny. “We will get back to you within 24 hours” is nice. “We are faster than your pizza delivery guy” is better.</p>\n<br />\n  <h2>3. You Are Overdressed or Underdressed</h2>\n  <p>Your branding should match your audience. If your target customer is local farmers, do not show up in a three piece corporate suit of stock photos and jargon. If your audience is luxury homeowners, do not wear flip flops made of Comic Sans.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Audit your look. Does your website, logo, and tone of voice feel like what your ideal customer would actually swipe right on?</p>\n\n  <h2>4. You Are Checking Your Phone Too Much</h2>\n  <p>If your marketing is all about chasing shiny objects like every new social platform or AI gimmick, you are the distracted date scrolling mid conversation.</p><br />\n  <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Pick one or two channels and commit. Depth beats dabbling. Nobody falls in love with “kind of consistent.”</p>\n\n  <h2>The Takeaway</h2>\n  <p>Marketing, like dating, is not about fireworks. It is about connection, attention, and showing up as your best self, consistently. Do that, and you will not be another bad date people warn their friends about. You will be the one they cannot stop talking about.</p>\n</article>\n',excerpt:"A funny but practical look at the habits that make customers ghost you and how to fix them.",image_url:"https://marketingcar.com/blog/awkwarddate.png"},{id:11,created_at:"2025-07-29T05:01:01+00:00",title:"Stop Spinning Your Wheels: Why Most Marketing Is Terrible (and How to Fix It)",slug:"most-marketing-is-terrible",content:'<article>\n  <header>\n    <h1>Stop Spinning Your Wheels: Why Most Marketing Sucks (and How to Fix It)</h1>\n    <p><strong>By Marketing Car</strong></p>\n  </header>\n\n  <section>\n    <p>Let’s face it: most small business marketing feels like driving with the emergency brake on.

Intentionally. Without stalling out halfway there.</p>\n\n<h2>What We Call Strategy (And What Most People Don’t)</h2>\n<p>Real strategy is how you get from where you are to where you want to be.

We’re here to help you stop driving blind. The right route, the right tools, the right message—built around your business, not someone else’s.</p>\n\n<p>Because growth isn’t an accident.<br />\nIt’s what happens when strategy meets action—with a real map in hand.</p>\n",excerpt:"Every week, someone shows up in our inbox thinking they need a new engine.
